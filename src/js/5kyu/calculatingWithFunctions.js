// This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

// seven(times(five()));   //  must return 35
// four(plus(nine()));     //  must return 13
// eight(minus(three()));  //  must return 5
// six(dividedBy(two()));  //  must return 3
// Requirements:

// There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
// There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy
// Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
// The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
// Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:
// eight(dividedBy(three()));

const zero = (operation) => !operation ? 0 : operation(0);

const four = (operation) => !operation ? 4 : operation(4);
const five = (operation) => !operation ? 5 : operation(5);
const six = (operation) => !operation ? 6 : operation(6);
const seven = (operation) => !operation ? 7 : operation(7);
const eight = (operation) => !operation ? 8 : operation(8);
const nine = (operation) => !operation ? 9 : operation(9);
